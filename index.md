# Dmitry Frumkin
I am an applied AI researcher using deep learning, machine learning, optimization, and classical algorithms.
My interests include NLP, Computer Vision, efficient deep learning.
When not working or studying, I like to spend time with my family, travel (25+ countries and counting), and play chess.

## What I’m Looking For

**What role am I interested in?**
An individual contributor / technical lead role (not a purely managerial one) working on cutting edge algorithms.

**What kind of problems excite me?**
Work with different modalities (text, image, video, etc.), ML at scale and performance optimizations, and turning research ideas into production systems.

**What am I looking for in a team?**
Technical strength, a culture of innovation, and the sense of ownership, resulting in modular, maintainable, and documented architectures.

**What environments do I do best in?**
Places where I can take ownership, move quickly from idea to implementation, and make a visible impact without heavy process overhead.
